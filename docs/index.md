# Documentation

Welcome to the EasyCFG Documentation. Here you'll find any information you need to know on how to install and use EasyCFG. Feel like something is missing, or found a typo? Go [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/CupOfTea696/EasyCFG/issues) and I'll try my best to update the Documentation as soon as possible. Any bugs you found can be reported there as well.

Happy Hacking!
